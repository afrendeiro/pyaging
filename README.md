## üêç **pyaging**: a Python-based compendium of GPU-optimized biological aging clocks

pyaging is a Python-based package with the latest and greatest aging clocks available to the longevity research community.

Given the increasing number of aging clocks, it is often cumbersome to compare them side by side. Moreover, for large amounts of data, the time for inference starts to become considerable. For such, we have developed a single package that can take in different molecular layers (DNA methylation, histone ChIP-Seq, ATAC-seq, transcriptomics, etc.) and utilize several aging clocks in a GPU-backed manner for fast inference. Moreover, this allows easy analysis of paired data from more than one molecular layer. 

## üìù To-Do List
